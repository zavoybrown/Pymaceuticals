In this challenge we were asked to analyze data from a medical study. In the study the subjects were identified with squamous cell carcinomas and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the drug regimens vs the final tumor size.
